- Document configuration options with sample values and explanations.
- Keep documentation up-to-date when changing functionality.
- Use descriptive variable and method names to improve self-documentation.
- Add inline comments for complex logic explaining the "why" not just the "what".
- Create markdown documentation for end-users in the docs/ directory.
- Include version compatibility information in all documentation.
- Document breaking changes prominently in CHANGELOG.md and README.md.

- Document expected environment variables and their purposes.
